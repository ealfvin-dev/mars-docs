                    <p>
                        MARS has a built-in debugger that checks for inconsistencies and mistakes in input data files.
                        The checks are run each time the Run button is clicked to run an input file. You can also run
                        the debugger without running your input file by clicking the Debug button.
                    </p>
                    <img src={require('./Images/debug.jpg')} width='496px' alt="Mars debug button" />
                    <p>
                        If an error is found, a message will be displayed below the input file and the line(s) where the
                        error occured will be highlighted in red if possible.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Splitting Input Files</h3>
                    <p>
                        When an input file is opened in the graphical interface, the file gets broken into individual series
                        anywhere the @SERIES annotation exists. If you end up with data for more than one series in a
                        tab when building your file, you can re-split the file into individual series tabs using the Split button.
                        The file will be split anywhere the @SERIES annotation exists. The splitting only exists in the
                        graphical interface to make it easier to navigate between connected series. The input file itself
                        remains a single file.
